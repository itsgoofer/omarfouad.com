It's been more than a year now, since the last time I published an article on this blog. I've noticed that my previous post [about Angular and Browserify](http://omarfouad.com/blog/2015/03/21/advanced-angularjs-structure-with-gulp-node-and-browserify/), gained a lot of traction (thanks for the tweets and emails, everyone) and this is one of the reasons why I think I should be back writing. 

I've been working on some projects that took almost all of my time in the past few months. I've learnt a lot and I have tons of stuff that I would like to share in the future. 

One of the major updates in my front-end development toolbox is, I actually ditched Angular for [VueJS](http://vuejs.org). Angular 1.x has been my JavaScript framework of choice for almost 3 years, and it took me a while to understand its ins and outs. When version 2 was released, the fact that I needed to change my mindset to use the same framework (in theory) seemed absurd. So I switched to Vue 1.x to then migrate to version 2 and the transition was fairly smooth.
