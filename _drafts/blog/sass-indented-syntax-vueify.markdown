title: Sass indented syntax in VueJS 2

Among all the available CSS preprocessors, SASS has been my language of choice, especially with indented syntax (.sass files). 

These days I'm rewriting an old web app using VueJS with the Browserify template (generated by the Vue CLI). In VueJS you can have .vue files, which are basically component files that are split into three parts: the template, the logic (JS) and the style (CSS). Vue provides a transform plugin for Browserify called Vueify, which handles these .vue files properly. The official Vueify documentation states that it supports preprocessors for HTML like jade, for JavaScript like CoffeeScript and ES2015 with Babel, and for CSS, like SASS and Stylus.
