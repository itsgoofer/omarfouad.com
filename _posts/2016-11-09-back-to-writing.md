It's been more than a year now, since the last time I published an article on this blog. I've noticed that my previous post [about Angular and Browserify](http://omarfouad.com/blog/2015/03/21/advanced-angularjs-structure-with-gulp-node-and-browserify/), gained some traction (thanks for the tweets and emails, everyone) and that's one of the reasons why I think I should start writing again.

I've been working on some projects that took almost all of my time in the past few months. I've learnt a lot and I have tons of stuff that I would like to share in the future.

One of the major updates in my front-end development toolbox is, I actually ditched Angular for [VueJS](http://vuejs.org)â€”more about that in a later post.

I've also rewritten most of the code for this blog and I had it built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (again). Actually I've been trying different languages/frameworks for this one, just for the sake of trying them. Wordpress (8 years ago), then Jekyll, then [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), then [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and now, I'm back to Jekyll, managing its content using [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com).

Stay tuned for more posts in the coming days. I have a couple of topics I would like to cover. If you have questions, or particular requests, don't hesitate to contact me.
